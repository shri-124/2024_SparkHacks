            <h2>Effects of Soil Temperature on Crop Growth:</h2>
            <p>Optimal soil temperature fosters robust root development, facilitating efficient water and nutrient uptake by plants. Additionally, it regulates photosynthesis rates, impacting plant biomass production and eventual yield.</p>
        <p>Soil temperature also governs various metabolic processes within plants, including enzyme activity and hormone synthesis, influencing flowering induction, fruit set, and stress responses to environmental cues such as drought and heat.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="practices">
            <h2>Soil Temperature Management Practices:</h2>
            <p>Farmers employ diverse techniques to manage soil temperature effectively, including continuous monitoring and measurement using soil sensors and remote sensing technologies.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, cultural practices such as adjusting planting dates, optimizing irrigation schedules, and implementing mulching techniques play a crucial role in moderating soil temperature and enhancing crop resilience.</p>
        <p>Additionally, judicious crop selection based on local soil temperature conditions and soil amendments like organic matter additions, cover cropping, and mulching contribute to improving soil health and overall agricultural productivity.</p>
